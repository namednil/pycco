PyccoTex is a close fork of Pycco which supports TeX-like math expressions thanks to MathJax.
The only difference is slight change in the html-header of each created document.

The command is just called: pyccotex 

Pycco is a Python port of Docco: the original quick-and-dirty, hundred-line-
long, literate-programming-style documentation generator. For more information,
